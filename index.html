<p>Hey, the name is Jetender Ghatorora and you are in my prortfolio/introduction site. In this site you gonna  see alot of "work in progress" as things are gonna be added over time,however there still stuff avaliable to you look over. In this part of the website I'm gonna just introduce myself a little.


    <br>


<p>Gonna tell you all that I am not a copy and paste individual nor special. I am someone who has a life and a personality that is similar but different amongst the people of the world. A little vague but kind of want to put that out there.

    <p>Anyways, you can associate me as a quiet but happy individual who likes to learn new things. Nevertheless I am keen to complete all my work on time and cooperate with my collegues on projects.  </p>
    

<p>Call me the "Wizard of the Code" when I actually get there. Still a  beginner in the world of programming languages I have a lot to learn to obtain that title but eager to learn. Objectively I am here to learn programming languages of vast types and keep honing my skills. Maybe with all the knowledge and skills I have obtained over the years can get me to make crazy and awesome programs. However the goal of my right now is to find a career I love.   </p>
